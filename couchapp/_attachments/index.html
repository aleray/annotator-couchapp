            <h1>Once upon a time there was school</h1>

            <p><em>There is no time. We have no time.</em></p>

            <p>What does it mean to say: there is no time, no place, not a thing,
                we no longer have time, places or things. According to us, statements
                such as these not only signal that every-thing, and every time
                and space, tends to be occupied, but also that there is or can
                be time, space and matter that is not occupied. And for that, we
                simply want to reserve the notion ‘school’. Perhaps today, especially
                today when it seems to disappear, we still remember what it is
                to have free time.</p>

            <p>School is literally a place of <em>scholè,</em> that is the space of
                ‘free time’.
                <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>                Originated in the Greek world, school was not a place and time
                organised to reproduce social order, or the life form of its elites.
                Disconnected from both the
                <em>oikos</em> and <em>polis</em>, and hence freed from daily,
                economic and political occupations, the school was a real space
                with a real inner place and time, where people were exposed to
                real things. Our thesis is that school time, place and matter is
                actually an invention, it includes a particular form that does
                certain things, and actually creates a particular time, space and
                matter. As a form, school includes at least three components.</p>

            <p>First, a typical feature of the school is <em>suspension</em>. Economic,
                social, cultural, political or private time is suspended, as well
                as the tasks and roles connected to specific places. Suspension
                here could be regarded as an act of de-privatization or de-appropriation.
                The school offers students for instance the opportunity to leave
                behind their past and family background, and indeed to become students
                like all the rest. And a similar suspension from the side of teachers
                (a profession that is not really a serious profession), and from
                the side of subject matter (knowledge and other things that are
                not for real). We are not claiming that this is what happens in
                education today – quite the contrary, there is the ongoing tendency
                to link students to their background for instance, to professionalise
                teaching or to make subject matter more relevant. The point however
                is that a school implies an act of suspension or setting free,
                and indeed, perhaps, that suspension is no longer part of education
                today.
            </p>

            <p>However, the term ‘free’ has not only the negative meaning of suspension
                (free from), but also a positive meaning, that is, free to. Drawing
                upon the terminology of Giorgio Agamben, we want to introduce the
                term
                <em>profanation</em> to describe this kind of freedom as the second
                feature of the school form. According to Agamben<a href="#fn2"
                    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>: “Pure, profane,
                freed from sacred names is that thing that is being replaced in
                view of the common use by people.” (p. 96) A condition of profane
                time, space and material thus is not a place of emptiness, but
                a condition where time, space and things are disconnected from
                their regular use, no longer scared or occupied in that sense,
                and hence it refers to a condition where something of the world
                is open for common use. Knowledge for example, but also skills,
                that have a particular function in society, become free for common
                use; disconnected from the usages of the old generation in society
                but not yet appropriated by students as representatives of the
                young generation. But important, it is in front of common things
                – open for free and thus new use – that the young generation is
                offered the opportunity to experience itself as a new generation,
                i.e. the experience of potentiality in front of some-thing. For
                that reason, at school it is always partly about knowledge for
                the sake of knowledge (what could be called ‘study’), or skills
                for the sake of skills (what could be called ‘exercise’), and thought
                for the sake of thought (what could be called ‘thinking’). And
                the consequence is not that the school is disconnected from society
                (an ‘ivory tower’, ‘island’, ‘unworldly’). The knowledge, skills
                and any other material of course are derived from society, but
                there is the simple but far reaching act of suspension and profanation.
                And that makes the school perhaps not a societal institution, but
                a worldly space and time.</p>

            <p>The school (through the teacher, school discipline and architecture)
                makes it possible for the new generation to become attentive for
                some-thing, that is, for the world. Hence, the third feature we
                want to mention here is that the school <em>makes attentive<strong>. </strong></em>In
                that sense, subjects or things – disconnected from particular usages
                and positions - become very real at school. Of course, not as a
                kind of resource, product or any other object that is occupied
                and part of a particular economy. The magical event of the school
                is that and when it turns matter into some-thing, that is, something
                to study or to exercise<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.
                School than becomes a space and time of <em>inter-esse</em>, and
                thus, where the young generation is not approached as those who
                have (specific, individual) needs and want to choose, but as those
                who are exposed to the world and are offered the opportunity to
                become interested in some-thing. The school is not about calculation
                and choices, but about attention and becoming interested in some-thing.</p>

            <p>In sum, the school could be regarded as a particular medium, a means
                without ends, that is a free place and time where something is
                offered, and without this offering establishing a particular destination
                or orientation
                <a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.
                <em>Scholè</em>, than, is not simply a time/space of passage (<em>from</em>                past <em>to</em> future), project-time or initiation-time (<em>from</em>                family <em>to</em> society). It is the time and space of attention
                which is the time of the regard for the world, of being present
                to it (or being in its presence), attending it, a time of delivery
                to the experience of the world, of exposure and effacing social
                subjectivities and orientations, a time filled with encounters
                and opportunities to study and exercise. Taking the swimmer who
                traverses the stream it could look like the swimmer simply goes
                from one land to another (from the land of ignorance to that of
                knowledge for example), as if the medium would be simply a point
                without dimension (as when we jump)
                <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>                . Of course, she ‘arrives’ in a second world, but more importantly,
                the swimmer did not only change river banks, but has known the
                trait that binds them and that is in fact a ‘place’ that integrates
                all directions, a ‘milieu’ that has no orientation itself, or,
                the other way round, opens to all directions and orientations.</p>

            <p>The dis-appearance of the school-form(s) as a form of suspension, profanation
                and attention that makes ‘free time’ is not just a far hypothesis
                but a real challenge to reinvent or shape a school form, that is,
                to make free time, space and matter. There is maybe one more development
                that besides the tendencies we already mentioned, strongly challenges
                this reinvention: ICT and the related creation of so-called digital
                learning environments and technology enhanced learning. Indeed
                the question is ever more strong: whether and how to make or sustain
                <em>scholè</em> in a time of information and communication technologies,
                of digital technologization and of globalization and the instant?
                What about the school form in, to draw on Bauman<a href="#fn6"
                    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, a liquid time?
                What about attention to things and the world in cyberspace? Maybe
                the virtual can function as a new way to make things real, to let
                them speak, to provoke thinking. And maybe there are new school
                forms today, but outside the field of education and learning as
                we know it.</p>

                        The Greek word ‘scholè’ means first of all ‘free time’ (other related meanings
                        are: delay, rest, study, school, school building). Free
                        time however is not so much leisure time, but rather the
                        time of study and exercise, the time separated from the
                        time of production. (See: Masschelein, J., Simons, M. (2010).
